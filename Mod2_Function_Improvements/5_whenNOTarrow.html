<!-- when not to use an arrow function in js.

With an arrow function the value of 'this' is not rebound inside of that function. Instead the value of 'this' is inherited from the parent.  -->

              points: 23,
              //the 'score' function increments the socre every time it is called.

          //when you need to write a prototype method

          class Car {
              constructor(make, colour) {
                  this.make = make;
                  this.colour = colour;

          };


          //_________________________________

          //when you need arguments object

          //note - 'arguments' is a keyword in js that gives us an array of everything pass in

          //this function takes unlimited arguments

          //const orderChildren = () => {  **the arrow function won't work here**
            const orderChildren = function() {
              const children = Array.from(arguments);
              return children.map((child, i) => {
                  return `${child} was child #${i+1}`;
              })
              console.log(arguments);
          }


          //TAKEAWAYS. If you will not need the 'this' keyword or the 'arguments' keyword, feel free to use the => function
